We are submitting again as we took a lateday and submitted the ssh link to our repo instead of https link. 
We were not able to submit the git repo because of the size of the repo. So, we just submitted the source code with a link to the repo.
However, the ssh link we submitted allows only a user who has a gitlab account and added a SSH key into it to clone from this repo via SSH.
So,now I have submitted the https link instead for the same repo. (https allows anyone to clone from the repo)
You can search for our project on gitlab as EightBallPool and verify this fact yourself.


Https Link of git repo:
https://gitlab.com/SSL-LabTeam/EightBallPool.git

ssh link of git repo:
git@gitlab.com:SSL-LabTeam/EightBallPool.git

Also, we took a lateday as the Beamer Presentation was not there in the folder we submitted earlier.

To be more careful,

The dropbox link of the git repo submitted on 20th october is:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/l7y4x24ln6094wc/lab12_group01_final0.tar.gz?dl=0

The dropbox link of the folder containing our final git repo after all changes:
